# Specification Quality Checklist: Design Sync & Integration Hub

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-23
**Feature**: `specs/006-design-sync-integration/spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *(narrative references acceptable; criteria generalized)*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (traceability table added)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (tool names only in narrative, not criteria)

## Notes

All checklist items satisfied. Specification is READY for planning (`/speckit.plan`).
